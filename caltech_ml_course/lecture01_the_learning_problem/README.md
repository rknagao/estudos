# Lecture 01 - The Learning Problem

- while human learning tries to determine an outcome y looking for the variables x, a machine learning would focus on outcome y to understand the impact of the variables x.
- a learning problem have 2 components: (1) the hypothesis set and (2) the learning algorithm. For example, to predict the total purchase value of a customer we can use a linear regression model which estimates (1) the coeficient of each variable while (2) minimizing the mean squared error of the prediction.
- basic premise of learning: "using a set of observations to uncover an underlying process". It also means that is necessary for a pattern to exist in the first place to be discovered by machine learning.
- three different ways of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforced learning.
