# Lecture 07 - The VC dimension

## Objective
1. Demonstrate the Growth Function with Break Point leads to a polynomial equation.
2. Demonstrate the Growth Function with Break Point can replace **M** in Hoeffding Inequality.

## Definition
VC dimensions will be a number based on a specific hypothesis set.

> In essence, is the **most points that can be reorganized or "shattered"**. (?)

> what is to shatter a hypothesis set?
